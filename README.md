# CODECRAFT_DS_01 - Task 1: Population Histogram

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at Code Craft.

## 🔧 Task Description
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or population across countries.

## 📁 Folders
- `data/`: Contains the downloaded dataset from Kaggle/World Bank.
- `notebook/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook used for analysis and visualization.
- `outputs/`: Contains the saved histogram image.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Output
The notebook generates a histogram that shows the distribution of population across selected countries or years.
## 📊 Age Distribution Histogram

### Chart Type Used
I used a **histogram** because age is a continuous variable, and histograms are best for visualizing how values are spread across intervals.

### Key Insight from the Chart
Most people in the population are **young adults aged 21–30**, indicating a relatively young demographic.
